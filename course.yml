release_status: beta
description: |-
  Build a decentralized lending protocol on the Solana blockchain. In this challenge,
  you'll create a secure lending smart contract using the Anchor framework that allows
  users to deposit collateral, borrow assets, repay loans, and face liquidation when
  undercollateralized.

  Along the way, you'll learn about Solana's account model, program-derived addresses
  (PDAs), cross-program invocations (CPI) for token operations, oracle integration for
  price feeds, and sophisticated lending mechanics including interest rates, health
  factors, and liquidation protocols.

  By the end, you'll have a fully functional lending protocol that demonstrates core
  DeFi concepts and Solana development best practices.
