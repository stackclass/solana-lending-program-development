short_name: Solana Lending
release_status: beta
description: |-
  Build a decentralized lending protocol on the Solana blockchain. In this challenge,
  you'll create a secure, on-chain lending program using Anchor framework that allows
  users to deposit collateral, borrow assets, and earn interest in a trustless manner.

  Along the way, you'll learn about Solana's account model, program-derived addresses (PDAs),
  cross-program invocations (CPI), SPL token integration, Pyth price oracles, and on-chain
  state management. You'll also master Rust for Solana development and understand how to
  build secure, gas-efficient smart contracts.

  By the end, you'll have a fully functional lending dApp that demonstrates core
  DeFi concepts and Solana development best practices.
summary: Build a decentralized lending protocol on Solana blockchain using Anchor framework
